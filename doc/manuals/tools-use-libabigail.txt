This tool uses the libabigail library to analyze the binary as well as its
associated debug information.  Here is its general mode of operation.

When instructed to do so, a binary and its associated debug
information is read and analyzed.  To that effect, libabigail analyzes
by default the descriptions of the types reachable by the interfaces
(functions and variables) that are visible outside of their
translation unit.  Once that analysis is done, an Application Binary
Interface Corpus is constructed by only considering the subset of
types reachable from interfaces associated to `ELF`_ symbols that are
defined and exported by the binary.  It's that final ABI corpus which
libabigail considers as representing the ABI of the analyzed binary.

Libabigail then has capabilities to generate textual representations
of ABI Corpora, compare them, analyze their changes and report about
them.

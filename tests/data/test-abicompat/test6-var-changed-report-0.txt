variables defined in library 'libtest6-var-changed-libapp-v1.so'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test6-var-changed-app' expects:

  S0* bar:
    in pointed to type 'struct S0':
      type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
      1 data member insertion:
        'char S0::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)

  S1* foo:
    in pointed to type 'struct S1':
      type size changed from 64 to 32 bits
      1 data member deletion:
        'unsigned char S1::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)

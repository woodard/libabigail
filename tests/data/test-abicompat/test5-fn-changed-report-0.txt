functions defined in library 'libtest5-fn-changed-libapp-v1.so'
have sub-types that are different from what application 'test5-fn-changed-app' expects:

  function void bar(S0*):
    parameter 1 of type 'S0*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S0':
        type size changed from 32 to 64 bits
        1 data member insertion:
          'char S0::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)

  function int foo(S1*):
    parameter 1 of type 'S1*' has sub-type changes:
      in pointed to type 'struct S1':
        type size changed from 64 to 32 bits
        1 data member deletion:
          'unsigned char S1::m1', at offset 32 (in bits)
